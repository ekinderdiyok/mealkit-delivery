## Executive Summary

**Problem:** How to best allocate marketing dollars to maximize the revenue?

**Background:** Our business employs multiple online marketing channels (e.g., Instagram, paid search, Reddit), targets several customer segments (e.g., seniors, couples, families). Marketing budget is limited and 

**Unique Challenge:** Given high churn rate, acquision metrics may not be the whole story. In other words, a marketing channel may yield plenty of subscribers, yet, these new subscribers may not materialize into sustained revenue. Second, acquiring new customers from a channel over a decade may cause the channel to saturate, increasing the **incremental customer acquision cost (iCAC)**.

**Objectives:** Evaluate the performance of marketing channels, campaigns, and target audiences. Calculate growth KPIs. Identify lagging marketing channels or audience mismatches.

**Recommendations:** Marketing team should conduct cohort studies to understand the churn patterns and customer lifetime value of customer acquired through different channels or demographics.
